Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are foundational to understanding modern AI. Rooted in the mid-20th century, ANNs are inspired by the biological processes of our brain, aiming to replicate human-like learning in machines.

## Layers Deep in Learning

A significant breakthrough came with Deep Learning. Here, 'deep' refers to the number of layers in the Neural Network. The more layers, the more complex patterns it can recognize. This depth allows AI to perform intricate tasks, from translating languages to playing board games at a world-class level.

## Convolutional and Recurrent: Variations on a Theme

There's no one-size-fits-all in neural networks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are fantastic for image recognition. They break down images into pixels, learn patterns, and can tell a cat from a dog or recognize a face.

On the other hand, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) excel in sequence prediction. They have a 'memory' of sorts, making them ideal for time series forecasting and understanding language.

## Challenges and the Road Ahead

While neural networks have sparked an AI revolution, they aren't without limitations. Training them demands significant computational power and data. Overfitting, where the AI performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly in real-world scenarios, is a persistent challenge.

However, the AI community is resilient. Innovations like transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is adapted for a new task, are reducing the need for vast datasets and computing power.

## In Conclusion

Neural networks have come a long way, powering most of the AI-driven innovations we see today. As we stand on the cusp of new discoveries, understanding the evolution and intricacies of neural networks is essential for anyone keen on the future of AI.
